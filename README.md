# PySecretSocks
A python SOCKS server for tunneling a connection over another channel

## Current State ##
Super broke!

### Features ###
- [x] Socks4a
- [ ] Socks5 - In progress
- [ ] Remote Class Communication
 - Need some serious work. Currently it takes waaaay to much to make a simple remote interface. Hopefully some tweaks in the IO class will make it easier?

### Bugs ###
- Socket with socks client does not close right. This causes massive memory usage
